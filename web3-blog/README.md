# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It implements a blog contract, a test for that contract, a script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.  The project on this repository uses it to validate entries for a blog.

It supports the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/deploy.js
npx hardhat help
```
